    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Brendan Burch and I am a Software Engineer at Quicken Loans. I've been with the company for 7 years (started in 2013). I was born in Detroit Michigan (1992) and lived in Michigan my whole life. I started my software/web development back at the end of 2018. I took a frontend web development bootcamp with Grand Circus from January 2019 to June 2019. Then in July of 2020, I attended another bootcamp with Grand Circus in July 2020 for software engineering (which I am still attending). I enjoy watching Movies (superhero/suspense/crime movies) and playing games with large groups of friends.</p>
